# The NoteWriter Desktop
# Main configuration file
# ~/.nt/editorconfig.yml (in complement to ~/.nt/config.yml for saved searched, etc.)


# List of workspaces (= The NoteWriter repositories)
# Useful when spliting work and life notes in different Git repositories while keeping the options to search across all collections of notes using the desktop application.
# (Ex; You can keep Go cheatsheets inside your main collection as can be useful if you change work and still want to search them at work)
workspaces:
- name: Main
  slug: main # Useful to reference in desks
  path: ~/notes
  selected: true # Selected by default
- name: My Company
  slug: my-company
  path: ~/Workshop/notes


# "Get inspired by" action
inspirations:
  dailyQuote: "path:references @kind:quote"
  categories:
  # Default can be
  # - name: Quotes
  #   workspace: all
  #   query: "@kind:quote"
  # - name: Art
  #   workspace: all
  #   query: "@kind:artwork"
  - name: Life
    workspace: main
    query: "path:references/persons (#life or #purpose) @kind:quote"
  - name: Art
    workspace: main
    query: "path:references @kind:artwork"
  # Complete with more inspirations


# List of desks
# (probably in a `~/.nt/editorconfig.json` file to be saved easily from the code without losing comments, formating)
# The NoteWriter Deskop must load this file at startup and support a save button to persist change in desks or new desks (like VS Code supports editing the configuration).
