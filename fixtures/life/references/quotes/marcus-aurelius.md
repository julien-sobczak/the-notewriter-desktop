# Marcus Aurelius

## Quote: On Bee hives

`#being`

What’s bad for the hive is bad for the bee.


## Quote: Memento Mori

`#death` `#productivity`

You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.


## Quote: Summum Bonum

`#doing`

Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. Cold or warm. Tired or well-rested. Despised or honored. Dying... or busy with other assignments.


## Quote: On Possible

`#thinking`

If something is humanly possible, it's attainable by you too.


## Note: Question to Himself

`@source: _Meditations_`

`#productivity` `#life-changing`

Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?

> A great way to found out which tasks are really important.
