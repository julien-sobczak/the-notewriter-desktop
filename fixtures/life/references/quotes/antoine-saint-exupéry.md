# Antoine Saint Exupéry


## Quote: On Lands

`#being`

We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.


## Quote: On Seeing With Heart

`@source: The Little Prince`

`#thinking` `#being`

It is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.
