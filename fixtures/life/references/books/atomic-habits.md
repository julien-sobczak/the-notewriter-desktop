# Atomic Habits


## Quote: On Building Your Identity

`#being`

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.


## Quote: Your System vs Your Goals

`#favorite`

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.


## Quote: On Direction

You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.


## Quote: Loving the Process

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you donâ€™t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.


## Quote: The Goal of Goals

Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.


## Quote: Winners and Losers

Winners and losers have the same goals.
