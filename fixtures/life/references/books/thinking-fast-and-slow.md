# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Quote: On Frequent Exposure

A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.

## Quote: On Important Things

Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.

## Quote: On Finding Sense

Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.

## Quote: On Simple Language

`#writing`

If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do.

## Quote: On Intelligence

`#intelligence`

Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed.
