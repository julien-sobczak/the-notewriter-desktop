# Memory


## Anti-Patterns


### Reference Rote Learning

`@source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning`

_Rote learning_ is a memorization technique based on repetition. The method rests on the premise that the recall of repeated material becomes faster the more one repeats it.


## Patterns


### Reference: Flashcards

`@source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition`

_Spaced repetition_ is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase the rate of learning.


### Reference: Testing effect

`@source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect`

The _testing effect_ (also known as _retrieval practice_, _active recall_, _practice testing_, or _test-enhanced learning_) suggests long-term memory is increased when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory.


## Techniques


### Reference: Method of Loci

`@source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci`

The _method of loci_ is a strategy for memory enhancement, which **uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments** in order to enhance the recall of information. The method of loci is also known as the _memory journey_, _memory palace_, _journey method_, _memory spaces_, or _mind palace technique_.


### Reference: Major System

`@source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system`

The _major system_ (also called the _phonetic number system_) is a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers.

The system works by converting numbers into consonants, then into words by adding vowels. The system works on the principle that **images can be remembered more easily than numbers**.
